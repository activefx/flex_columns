# flex_columns

`flex_columns` gives you the flexibility of schema-free columns on top of a proven relational database. It adds
additional niceties on top of a simple JSON-based serialization mechanism, attempting to walk a nice line between
being completely free (and letting you clutter up your database with garbage) and being so restrictive that you
might as well just add columns to your schema in the first place.
